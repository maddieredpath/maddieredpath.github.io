<p>I have always been into sports, for as long as I can remember.  
Although I danced for 7 years of my life, for the past 3 years,  
fitness has been my main goal. I began heavy lifting right before  
COVID. During the pandemic, most of my life was committed to   
physical health. I know am part of the executive team of a new  
club called <b>WWW</b> (Women's Weightlifting and Wellness). This is a  
club to help women feel more confortable in the weightroom, as  
well as other things. </p>
